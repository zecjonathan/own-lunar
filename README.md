# Lunar Client with Mod Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of adding a mod to Lunar Client. We'll go through the steps required to integrate a mod into your Lunar Client setup.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Lunar Client installed on your system
- The mod you wish to add to Lunar Client

## Step 1: Accessing Lunar Client Directory

1. Launch Lunar Client on your computer.
2. Navigate to the installation directory of Lunar Client. This can vary depending on your operating system:
   - **Windows**: Not yet tested
   - **MacOS**: Usually found in `~/Users/$your-name$/.lunarclient/offline/multiver/mods/$mc-version$`
   - **Linux**: Not yet tested

## Step 2: Adding Your Mod

1. Place your mod file (usually ending with `.jar` extension) into the `mods` directory.
2. Ensure that the mod you are adding is compatible with the version of Lunar Client you are using. Using incompatible mods can cause issues or even crashes.

## Step 3: Launching Lunar Client with the Mod

1. Once you've added the mod to the `mods` directory, close any instances of Lunar Client if they are open.
2. Relaunch Lunar Client.
3. If the mod is properly installed and compatible, you should be able to see its effects in-game.
4. Lunar will remind you, if any of your mods are not compatible

## Step 4: Troubleshooting

- **Compatibility Issues**: If the mod doesn't work or Lunar Client fails to launch after adding the mod, ensure that the mod is compatible with the version of Lunar Client and Minecraft you are using. You may need to check for updates or find an alternative mod.
- **Conflicting Mods**: Sometimes, mods can conflict with each other, causing unexpected behavior. Try removing other mods to see if the issue persists.
- **Error Logs**: Check the Lunar Client logs for any error messages that might provide clues about why the mod isn't working as expected.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Enjoy your modded version of Lunar.
